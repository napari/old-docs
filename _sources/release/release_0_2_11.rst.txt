napari 0.2.11
===========================

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.2.11!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

Highlights
**********
- Point face color and edge color are now settable as a property in a columnar data table, mapped using a colormap (continuous values) or a color cycle (categorical values). See `this example <https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/master/examples/add_points_with_properties.py>`_ for syntax details.
- Python 3.8 is now supported.
