# napari 0.1.5

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.1.5! napari is a fast,
interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for
browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built
on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the
scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).
