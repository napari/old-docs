napari 0.2.0
==========================

We're happy to announce the release of napari v0.2.0!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-base
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

New Features
------------
- **Improved UI**, unifying buttons from controls, icons for layers,
  and more understandable dimensions sliders
- Add support for **3D rendering** for all our layer types
- Add a `Surface` layer to render already generated meshes. Support nD meshes
  rendered in 2D or 3D.
- Add `viewer.add_multichannel` method to rapidly add expand a multichannel
  array along one particular axis with different colormaps (`#528 <https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/528>`_).
- Add basic **undo / redo** functionality to the labels layer

Deprecations
------------
- Drop `napari.view` method. Replaced with `napari.view_*` methods in for all
  our layer types.
- Drop `Pyramid` layer. Pyramid functionality now integrated into both the
  labels and image layer.
