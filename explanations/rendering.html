<h1>Rendering in napari<a class="headerlink" href="#rendering-in-napari" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document outlines our plans for making napari’s rendering non-blocking. We
hope to update this document as we progress so it can be an accurate record of
the final implementation.</p>
<div class="section" id="blocked-ui">
<h2>Blocked UI<a class="headerlink" href="#blocked-ui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In May 2020 we looked into these three issues related to napari’s blocked UI:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 44%" />
<col style="width: 56%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Issue</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Summary</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/845">#845</a></p></td>
<td><p>UI blocked by Disk or Network IO while rendering multi-scale images</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300">#1300</a></p></td>
<td><p>UI blocked while rendering large in-memory images (not multi-scale)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a></p></td>
<td><p>UI blocked while rendering small images due to lazy computations</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When the UI is “blocked” napari feels slow and lags. It’s not just an aesthetic
issue, manipulation of interactive UI elements like sliders becomes nearly
impossible if the framerate is low enough. Blocking can even lead to the
“spinning wheel of death” on Macs indicating the application is hung.</p>
<p>Napari is very extensible and customizable and users can create what amounts to
custom applications built on top of napari. In those cases a blocked UI doesn’t
just hamper viewing images, it can take down their entire application. For all
of these reasons we never want napari’s GUI thread to block.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="framerate">
<h2>Framerate<a class="headerlink" href="#framerate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most screens refresh at 60Hz and ideally GUI applications draw at the same
speed. If 60Hz cannot be achieved the application should draw as fast as
possible. Slow framerates lead to bad user experiences:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 43%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Framerate</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Milliseconds</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>User Experience</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>60Hz</p></td>
<td><p>16.7</p></td>
<td><p>Great</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>30Hz</p></td>
<td><p>33.3</p></td>
<td><p>Good</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>20Hz</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
<td><p>Acceptable</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>10Hz</p></td>
<td><p>100</p></td>
<td><p>Bad</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>5Hz</p></td>
<td><p>200</p></td>
<td><p>Unusable</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Even if the average rate is fast, applications are called
<a class="reference external" href="http://jankfree.org/">janky</a> if their framerate jumps around. Even one slow
frame can be annoying to the user. We want napari’s average framerate to be high
but we also want the framerate to be as consistent as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="array-like-interface">
<h2>Array-like Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#array-like-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Napari renders data out of an “array-like” interface, it can use any object that
supports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code>’s slicing syntax. This is a powerful abstraction, but the
flexibility creates a huge challenge for napari. Many graphics applications have
specific and customized data formats, but napari needs to work with basically
any source of data.</p>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="https://dask.org/">Dask</a> or custom code it’s possible that an array access
will result in disk or network IO. It’s even possible the data does not exist at
all and it will be computed on-the-fly. In this case the user’s code is doing
the computation and napari has no control or visibility into the computation or
how long it will take.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/845">#845</a> the array access leads to
loading data from disk or over the network. In
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a> the array access leads to
a machine learning calculation with Torch. In
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300">#1300</a> the problem is different.
There the data is already entirely in memory, but it’s not chunked. In that
particular case we transfer 100’s of MB to the card in one shot and this
is what blocks the UI. We can’t allow huge monolithic arrays of data in napari.
Everything must be broken down into reasonably sized chunks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to never block the GUI thread we need to do two things:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Always break data into chunks. The exact maximum chunk size is TBD.</p></li>
<li><p>Never call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asarray</span></code> on user data from the GUI thread since we don’t know
what it will do or how long it will take.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="render-algorithm">
<h2>Render Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#render-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The renderer will compute the <strong>working set</strong> based on the current view. The
working set is the set of chunks that we need to draw to fully render that
specific view. The renderer will step through every chunk in the working set and
do one of these three things:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 40%" />
<col style="width: 60%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Case</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Action</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Chunk is in VRAM</p></td>
<td><p>Render the chunk</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Chunk is in RAM but not VRAM</p></td>
<td><p>Transfer the chunk to VRAM if there is time</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Chunk is not in RAM</p></td>
<td><p>Ask the <cite>ChunkLoader</cite> to load the chunk</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If a chunk cannot be drawn a placeholder will be drawn instead. What we draw as
a placeholder is TBD and it may vary depending on the situation. In some cases
we might be able to draw a lower resolution version of the data, which can be
refined later as more data is available. In the worst case we might have to draw
a blank grid or a loading animation.</p>
<p>The important thing about this algorithm is it never blocks. It draws what it
can and works on getting more stuff to be drawable next time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chunks">
<h2>Chunks<a class="headerlink" href="#chunks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Chunks</strong> is a deliberately vague term. For our purposes <em>a chunk is data used
to render a portion of the scene</em>. Without chunks we have only two choices:
render nothing or render the entire scene. With chunks we can partially render
the scene using whatever chunks are currently available, and we can
progressively add more chunks as more data is loaded.</p>
<p>Progressive rendering is valuable because the user can often navigate or make
other decisions with partially loaded data, so the user can work faster. Also
progressive rendering just feels more pleasant for the user. Progressive rending
makes the internal state of the application visible which is often leads to a
better user experience.</p>
<div class="section" id="chunked-file-formats">
<h3>Chunked File Formats<a class="headerlink" href="#chunked-file-formats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most common types of chunks are blocks of contiguous memory inside a chunked
file format like <a class="reference external" href="https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Zarr</a> and exposed by
an API like Dask. If an image is stored without chunks then reading any
given small 2D region of the image requires many different read operations. The
bytes for that region are spread throughout the file, intermingled with the
bytes from other regions. With chunking you can read a rectangular region with a
single read operation.</p>
<p><img alt="chunked-format" src="../_images/chunked-format.png" /></p>
<p>For 3D images the chunks are using 3D, but the idea is the same.
<a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.google/projects/neuroglancer">Neuroglancer</a> often recommends
that data is stored in 64x64x64 chunks such that each chunk contains 256,000
voxels. Using cubes is nice because you get the same performance whether you are
viewing the data in XY, XZ or YZ orientations. It’s also nice because you can
scroll through slices quickly since on average you have 32 slices above and
below your current location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-chunks">
<h3>Creating Chunks<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-chunks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300">#1300</a> there are no chunks
since the images were created in memory as one monolithic array. To solve
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300">#1300</a> we are going to have to
break that array into chunks, so we can send the data to the graphics card
incrementally. In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a> the
images are small so they are not chunked, but there are 3 image <strong>layers</strong> per
slice. In that case the <em>image layers are our chunks</em>. In general we can get
creative with chunks, they can be spatial or non-spatial subdivisions, basically
anything we want. As long as something can be loaded and drawn independently it
can be a chunk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="loading-into-ram-and-vram">
<h2>Loading into RAM and VRAM<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-into-ram-and-vram" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Getting data into VRAM where we can draw it is a two step process. First it
needs to be loaded into RAM and then transferred into VRAM. Loading into RAM
must be done in a thread since we don’t know how long it will take. For example
loading data over the internet or doing a complex calculation to produce the
data could both take a really long time.</p>
<p>Loading into VRAM is a different story because it must happen in the GUI thread,
at least with OpenGL. Therefore we need to amortize the transfer over some
number of frames. We will set a budget, for example 5 milliseconds. Each frame
can spend up to that much time loading data into VRAM before it starts drawing.
It’s important that no single chunk takes more than 5 milliseconds to transfer,
otherwise we will definitely go over our budget when we transfer that chunk. So
our budget determines our maximum chunk size.</p>
<p><img alt="paging-chunks" src="../_images/paging-chunks.png" /></p>
<p>When the rendering process is viewed as a timeline, the rendering thread has
regularly spaced frames, while the IO and compute threads load data into RAM in
parallel. When a paging/compute operation finishes it puts the data into RAM and
marks it as available, so the renderer can use it during the next frame.</p>
<p><img alt="timeline" src="../_images/timeline.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-1320">
<h2>Example: #1320<a class="headerlink" href="#example-1320" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a> the images are not
chunked since they are very small, but there are 3 layers per slice. These
per-slice layers are our chunks. Some layers are coming off disk while some are
computed. The “working set” is the set of chunks we need to draw the full
current scene. In this case we need the visible layers for the current slice.</p>
<p><img alt="example-1320" src="../_images/example-1320.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-845">
<h2>Example: #845<a class="headerlink" href="#example-845" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/845">#845</a> we are drawing a
multi-scale image which is chunked on disk.</p>
<div class="section" id="chunk-size">
<h3>Chunk Size<a class="headerlink" href="#chunk-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s confusing but there can be different chunk sizes in play at one time. Dask
chunks are often larger than the file format’s chunks. This means loading one
Dask chunk will cause many disk chunks to load. We might set our rendering
chunks to be the same size that Dask is using, if we can determine that, or we
might chose a different size.</p>
<p>In the end there are two different types of speed: framerate and load time. As
long as the chunk size is not too big we should be able to get a good framerate.
However loading speed can be trickier and can depend on many factors. If chunk
sizes are not aligned we might end up loading more data that we need, which will
slow us down.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a tradeoff, perhaps we can speed up loading by slowing the
framerate a bit. Hopefully we can come up with defaults that work well for most
situations, but we’ll probably need to provide a way for the user to tune the
chunk size and other parameters if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="octree">
<h3>Octree<a class="headerlink" href="#octree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To solve <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a> our chunks will
be layers. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChunkLoader</span></code> can write the data into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Image</span></code> object for those
layers. However with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/845">#845</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300">#1300</a> chunks are spatial so we
need a new spatial datastructure that can keep track of which chunks are in
memory and store the per-chunk data. We are going to use an octree. See
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkoctree">Apple’s</a> nice
illustration of an octree:</p>
<p><img alt="octree" src="../_images/octree.png" /></p>
<p>In a quadtree every square node is divided into 4 children representing the 4
spatial quadrants of that node: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left and
lower-right. An octree is the same idea but in 3D: every node has up to 8 children,
the 4 on top and the 4 on the bottom.</p>
<p>We can use our octree for 2D situations just by restricting ourselves to the top
4 children. So we plan to always use the same octree datastructure, we’ll use it
for both 2D and 3D data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-resolution">
<h3>Multi-resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-resolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Like image pyramids the octree can store many versions of the same data at
different resolutions. The root node contains a downsampled depiction of the
entire dataset. As the user zooms in, we descend into child nodes which contain
ever smaller portions of the data, but at ever higher resolutions.</p>
<p>In all cases if a chunk is not in memory it will be requested from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChunkLoader</span></code>. Until the data is in memory the renderer will draw a
placeholder. In many cases the best placeholder will be from a different level
of the octree. This will produce the familiar effect where the image is
initially blurry but then “refines” as more data is loaded. In the worst case if
no stand-in is available the placeholder can be a blank grid, potentially with
some sort of “loading” animation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beyond-images">
<h3>Beyond Images<a class="headerlink" href="#beyond-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are starting with 2D images but we are going to build the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChunkLoader</span></code> and
octree in a generic way so that we can add in more layer types over time,
including 3D images, points, shapes and meshes. 2D images are the simplest case,
but we believe most of the infrastructure we create can be used by the other
layer types as well.</p>
<p>There are several reasons the other layer types might be harder than 2D images:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Downsampling images is fast and well understood but “downsampling” geometry
can be slow and complicated. Plus this is no one definitive result, there
will be complicated trade-offs for speed and quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes we will to want downsample versions of things into a format that
represents the data but does not look like data. For example instead of
seeing millions of tiny points, the user might want to see a heatmap or
bounding boxes indicating where the points are located. Many different types of
visual aggregation are possible and we will need to experiment and get user
feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>With images the data density is spatially uniform but with geometry it can
vary drastically. You can pack millions of points/shapes/triangles into a
tiny area. This subverts spatial subdivision schemes and handling this
gracefully might require other solutions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily we don’t need to solve all of these problems at once. We will start with
2D images and grow from there. It’s not necessary that all layers types use an
octree. To start we can use an octree for images but render other layers without
any spatial organization. This will work fine as long as we can render all the
data in those other layer types quickly enough.</p>
<p>We could also start using an octree with a non-image layer type but use a <em>very</em>
simplistic downsampling scheme at first, for example just show bounding boxes.
Then we can improve the downsampling method over time. In general we can
incrementally improve the rendering system in many ways.</p>

<h3>Implementation Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-plan" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will resolve <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a> first with
these steps:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Create a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChunkLoader</span></code> class that uses an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;thread_worker</span></code> thread pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSource</span></code> class whose data may or may not be in memory.</p></li>
<li><p>The paging thread will put its data into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataSource</span></code> and trigger a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">draw()</span></code>
so the renderer will draw the new data.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_set_view_slice</span></code>  will become the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">draw()</span></code> method. It will draw
the chunks that it can and request or transfer the rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with out how we set the size of the thread pool.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1320">#1320</a> resolved the next big
step will be creating an octree and the related infrastructure to take on
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/845">#845</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300">#1300</a>. Once more is known about
the octree we will document it here.</p>

<h3>A. Number of Worker Threads<a class="headerlink" href="#a-number-of-worker-threads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>How many worker threads should we have? The challenge is the optimal numbers of
threads will depend on the workload, but we don’t know what’s going on behind
the array-like interface. Some possible workloads:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 27%" />
<col style="width: 73%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Workload</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Optimal Number Of Threads</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Local IO</p></td>
<td><p>Depends on the device and the access patterns.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Networked IO</p></td>
<td><p>A large number since setup costs are large and compute is minimal</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Small Compute (1 core)</p></td>
<td><p>We probably want one thread per available core.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Big Compute (all cores)</p></td>
<td><p>Maybe we want just one thread total.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We will probably try to aim for “reasonable defaults which yield reasonable
performance”. If necessary we might have ways for the user to configure the
number of threads. A fancy thing would be try to infer what’s going on and
have napari adjust the number of threads dynamically.</p>

<h3>B. Threads, Processes and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asyncio</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#b-threads-processes-and-asyncio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hopefully we can stick with threads for parallelism. However in Python threads
cannot run completely independently of each other due to the <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/python-features/pythons-gil-a-hurdle-to-multithreaded-program-d04ad9c1a63">Global Interpreter
Lock
(GIL)</a>.
Luckily in many cases a thread will release the GIL to do IO or
compute-intensive operations. During those spans of time the threads <em>can</em> run
independently.</p>
<p>The GIL only applies to threads that are actively running Python bytecode. Only
one thread can be executing bytecode at a time. The GIL server a useful purpose,
it makes Python threads safer to use than threads in many languages. In Python
two threads can in many cases access the same datastructure without a lock
because the GIL serves as kind of a universal lock for all datastructures.</p>
<p>If our threads interfere with either other too much and performance suffers we
might consider switching to processes at least some of the time. Processes offer
total independence, but processes do not share memory by default, so that could
add complexity.</p>
<p>Python also has <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> which
gives you concurrency but not necessarily parallelism. The advantage is the
concurrent tasks are much lighter weight than threads. In some languages you can
have millions of concurrent tasks going at once. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asyncio</span></code> is relatively new and
we should keep it in mind for rendering and for other purposes.</p>

<h3>C. VRAM and Vispy<a class="headerlink" href="#c-vram-and-vispy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With OpenGL you cannot directly manage VRAM. Instead we will control what’s in
VRAM by creating and drawing <a class="reference external" href="http://vispy.org/">vispy</a> objects. By drawing
objects in our working set VRAM will soon contain what we want. We will tightly
manage the construction and destruction of vispy objects to match the current
working set. We also have to make sure that we don’t create too many new objects
in one frame which could cause us to exceed our time budget.</p>
<p>This document does not get into vispy only because we don’t know those details yet.</p>
