# Announcement: napari 0.2.7

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.2.7! napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website: https://github.com/napari/napari

- Threshold slider for much improved isosurface rendering
- Dockable widgets (!)
